# World Values Survey - mapping
Using this repository, you can find an easy TXT to map countries with their respective codes and culture zones.

I couldnt' find a readily available resource for the mapping of countries to V2 country codes. Also, mapping countries to culture zones seemed to require reading them from an image on the official website (https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp )

That's why i decided to share the work I need to do anyway. I hope it helps you to finish your work quicker :)
